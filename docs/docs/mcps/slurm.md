Allocate 2 compute nodes with 8 cores each for an interactive analysis session, then deallocate when finished.
```

**Tools called:**
- `allocate_slurm_nodes` - Allocate interactive nodes
- `get_node_info` - Check node status and resources
- `get_allocation_status` - Monitor allocation efficiency
- `deallocate_slurm_nodes` - Clean up allocated resources

This prompt will:
- Use `allocate_slurm_nodes` to request interactive compute resources with optimization
- Use `get_node_info` to verify node availability and resource status
- Use `get_allocation_status` to monitor allocation usage and efficiency
- Use `deallocate_slurm_nodes` to clean up resources when analysis is complete

### 4. Job Management and Cleanup
```
I have a long-running job that needs to be cancelled, and I want to retrieve the output from a completed job before cleaning up.
```

**Tools called:**
- `cancel_slurm_job` - Cancel running job with cleanup
- `get_job_output` - Retrieve completed job outputs
- `get_job_details` - Get final job performance metrics

This prompt will:
- Use `cancel_slurm_job` to safely terminate the running job with intelligent cleanup
- Use `get_job_output` to retrieve both stdout and stderr from completed jobs
- Use `get_job_details` to analyze final performance metrics and resource utilization

### 5. Comprehensive Cluster Analysis
```
Analyze the current cluster queue status, identify bottlenecks, and suggest optimal resource allocation for my pending jobs.
```

**Tools called:**
- `get_slurm_info` - Get cluster status and capacity
- `get_queue_info` - Analyze queue performance and bottlenecks
- `list_slurm_jobs` - Review pending job queue and priorities

This prompt will:
- Use `get_slurm_info` to assess overall cluster capacity and resource availability
- Use `get_queue_info` to analyze partition-specific queue performance and bottlenecks
- Use `list_slurm_jobs` to review pending jobs and identify optimization opportunities

### 6. HPC Workflow Optimization
```
I need to optimize my computational workflow by analyzing my recent job performance, understanding cluster utilization patterns, and planning future submissions with better resource allocation.
```

**Tools called:**
- `list_slurm_jobs` - Review recent job history and performance patterns
- `get_job_details` - Analyze specific job performance metrics
- `get_slurm_info` - Understand cluster capacity and optimization opportunities
- `get_queue_info` - Analyze queue performance for optimal timing

This prompt will:
- Use `list_slurm_jobs` to examine historical job performance and identify trends
- Use `get_job_details` to deep-dive into resource utilization and efficiency metrics
- Use `get_slurm_info` to understand cluster constraints and optimization opportunities
- Use `get_queue_info` to plan optimal submission timing and partition selection
