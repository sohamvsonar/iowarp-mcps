- **Actions**: 1
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-24

## 🛠️ Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (recommended)
- Linux/macOS environment (Windows supported)

<details>
<summary><b>Install in Cursor</b></summary>

Go to: `Settings` -> `Cursor Settings` -> `MCP` -> `Add new global MCP server`

Pasting the following configuration into your Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file is the recommended approach. You may also install in a specific project by creating `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project folder. See [Cursor MCP docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for more info.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "compression-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["iowarp-mcps", "compression"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install in VS Code</b></summary>

Add this to your VS Code MCP config file. See [VS Code MCP docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) for more info.

```json
"mcp": {
  "servers": {
    "compression-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["iowarp-mcps", "compression"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install in Claude Code</b></summary>

Run this command. See [Claude Code MCP docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/tutorials#set-up-model-context-protocol-mcp) for more info.

```sh
claude mcp add compression-mcp -- uvx iowarp-mcps compression
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install in Claude Desktop</b></summary>

Add this to your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json` file. See [Claude Desktop MCP docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) for more info.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "compression-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["iowarp-mcps", "compression"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Manual Setup</b></summary>

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
CLONE_DIR=$(pwd)
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-mcps.git
uv --directory=$CLONE_DIR/iowarp-mcps/mcps/Compression run compression-mcp --help
```

**Windows CMD:**
```cmd
set CLONE_DIR=%cd%
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-mcps.git
uv --directory=%CLONE_DIR%\iowarp-mcps\mcps\Compression run compression-mcp --help
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:CLONE_DIR=$PWD
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-mcps.git
uv --directory=$env:CLONE_DIR\iowarp-mcps\mcps\Compression run compression-mcp --help
```

## Available Actions

### `compress_file`

**Description**: Compress a file using gzip compression with detailed statistics and performance analytics. Supports all file types with comprehensive error handling.

**Parameters**: file_path: Absolute path to the file to compress



## Examples

### Log File Compression and Storage Optimization

```
I have large log files in my application directory at /var/log/application.log that are taking up significant storage space. Can you compress them to save storage?
```

**Tools used:**
- **compress_file**: Compress the log file with gzip compression

### Data Archival and Backup Preparation

```
I need to archive my research data files before backing them up. Compress the dataset file at /data/research/experimental_results.csv to reduce backup time and storage requirements.
```

**Tools used:**
- **compress_file**: Compress the research dataset for archival

### Transfer Optimization for Network Efficiency

```
Before transferring large data files over the network, I want to compress /home/user/documents/large_document.pdf to reduce transfer time and bandwidth usage.
```

**Tools used:**
- **compress_file**: Compress document for network transfer optimization

### Bulk Storage Management

```
My application generates large output files at /tmp/processing_output.txt that need to be compressed for long-term storage management.
```

**Tools used:**
- **compress_file**: Compress application output files

### Development Environment Cleanup

```
I have temporary files and logs in my development environment that are consuming too much disk space. Compress /dev/temp/debug_output.log to free up storage.
```

**Tools used:**
- **compress_file**: Compress development files for space management

### System Administration and Maintenance

```
As part of system maintenance, I need to compress old system logs at /var/log/system.log to maintain system performance and storage efficiency.
```

**Tools used:**
- **compress_file**: Compress system logs for maintenance operations
